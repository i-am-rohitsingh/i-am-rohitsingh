# 💫 About Me:
I am a Product Engineer and iOS Developer with a foundation built on versatility and a current mission of mastery. My engineering journey began by navigating various ecosystems—working with Java, PHP, .NET, and MySQL—which gave me a broad understanding of how software works from the database to the UI.<br><br>🚀 What I’m Doing Now<br><br>Today, my heart is in the Apple ecosystem. I’ve transitioned into specialized iOS development, and I am currently dedicated to learning mobile development in depth. I’m not just interested in making things work; I’m interested in how they work under the hood, from memory management to high-performance architecture.<br><br>I thrive on solving challenges. Whether it’s debugging a complex race condition or architecting a new feature, I enjoy the puzzle of engineering. My daily toolkit includes Swift and Xcode, supported by a robust workflow using Git, Postman, Datadog, and Jenkins for continuous integration and monitoring.<br><br>🤝 Collaboration & Growth<br><br>I believe that great software is a team sport.<br><br>Seeking Mentorship: I am actively looking for a mentor to help me refine my iOS expertise and navigate the nuances of senior-level mobile engineering.<br><br>Open to Work: I am available for freelance opportunities and always open to collaborating on interesting Pull Requests.<br><br>🛠 Tech Summary<br><br>Primary: Swift (iOS)<br><br>Legacy/Broad Knowledge: Java, PHP, .NET, MySQL<br><br>DevOps & Tools: Xcode, Jenkins, Datadog, Postman, Git<br><br>🏎 Beyond the Code<br><br>When I’m not at my desk, you’ll likely find me on the move. I have a passion for driving and staying active through badminton, swimming, and table tennis. I’m also a firm believer in the power of a good story—whether I'm getting lost in a book or catching a movie.
